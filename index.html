                    <h3>Spotify to CSV</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a little project I made for someone I know who needed track listings for a 
                        Spotify playlist to be exported to an Excel file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This website uses the Spotify API to get the listed songs in a playlist, and output the titles, 
                        artists, and song length in a downloadable csv file. In order for the Spotify API to function it 
                        also requires getting permission from the user to access their account data, and using access 
                        tokens and refresh tokens to request the information.

                        A recipe sharing website where users can find recipes, post and edit their own recipes, 
                        and favourite recipes from other users.

                        This project was made using React and MongoDB, and includes signing up, creating a 
                        recipe for storage in the database, and the ability to favourite other user's recipes.

                        My work was mainly on the back-end, but I also created and implemented some 
                        front-end logic and played a significant role in the overall styling of the page.
